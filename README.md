# Beanbot - A DIY Slow Feeder

Free to download, 3d print and build, battery-powered slow feeder for coffee grinders

A simple, fast-to-build slow feeder to help you test and experience the impact of controlled bean feeding on grind consistency and extraction.

This project is intended as a learning and experimentation tool.
If you want a set-and-forget, variable-speed, daily-use version, see the metal upgrade at www.madkatcoffee.com.

## Why slow feeding?

Slow feeding:

Reduces fines generation

Reduces heat generation

Improves shot to shot consistency with a motorized feeder

## Many users report:

Improved clarity

Better flavour separation

Improved aroma

This DIY design exists so you can try it yourself.

## What this is (and isn’t)

### This is:

A simple ON/OFF slow feeder

Battery powered (2× AA)

Easy to print and assemble

Includes separate cassette wheels for feed speed reduction.

Designed to work with adapters that can be modified to suit your grinder. The included EK43 adapter has been included as a step file so you can modify/remix as you need to suit your grinder.

### This is not:

A variable speed feeder

A finished product


## Build overview

Build time: ~30–45 minutes

Print time: ~12 hours (depends on printer)

## Final note

This project exists because slow feeding has become a key part of our daily process for unlocking next level flavour and we want more people to experience it.

Remember, if you're making coffee at home you're already winning. So have fun with this build! Slow feeding is at the deeper end of the rabbit hole but the flavour improvement has been proven and confirmed by many leading coffee experts including Lance Hedrick, James Hoffman and Matt Perger at Barista Hustle.
 
Build it. Test it. Break it. Have fun with it!
